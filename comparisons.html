                          <p>Three observable trends found in the data are that temperature and humidity change dramatically based upon latitude. So a strong inverse or positive relationship was observed between changes in the latitude and changes in the temperature and humidity. The second observable trend was that wind speed and cloudiness were not so strongly correlated with changes in latitude. This means that the chances of having the same cloudiness and wind speed at various latitudes are pretty high. The third observable trend was that wind speed and cloudiness increase as we move up the latitude in the northern hemisphere. This suggests that as we move towards the North Pole, more extreme weather phenomena such as high winds, heavy snowfall, and heavy rainfall can be observed.</p>
